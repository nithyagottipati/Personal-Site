# Hey there!
I created this site in December of 2022 using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I wanted to build a site that highlighted my experiences, efforts, and passions all while honing in on web development and design skills!

I haven't any experience with building sites from the bottom-up like this before, but I'm hoping to get a good experience out of this through lots of coding and Googling! Thanks for stopping by :)
